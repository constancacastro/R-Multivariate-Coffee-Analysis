# Coffee Sensory Data Analysis (R)

##### Done in group within the curricular course of ´TEM´at Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa.

This project was developed as part of a practical assignment and focuses on the multivariate statistical analysis of sensory evaluations performed on 40 coffee beans from two different varieties: **Gesha** and **Caturra**.  

The dataset includes the following sensory attributes:  
- **X1 - Aroma**: fragrance of the coffee  
- **X2 - Flavor**: taste, including sweetness, bitterness, and acidity  
- **X3 - Aftertaste**: flavor that remains after swallowing  
- **X4 - Acidity**: brightness and liveliness of the flavor  
- **X5 - Body**: thickness or viscosity of the coffee in the mouth  
- **X6 - Balance**: harmony among the flavor components  
- **X7 - Variety**: coffee bean variety (Gesha or Caturra)  

### Tasks performed:
- **Descriptive analysis** of multivariate data  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
- **Cluster Analysis**  
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**  
- **Multiple Linear Regression**, explaining Flavor (X2) based on the other variables  

The project was entirely implemented in **R**, and the results are presented in a detailed report (in Portuguese).
